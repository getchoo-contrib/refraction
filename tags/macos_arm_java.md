On macOS arm64, also known as Apple Silicon (M1, M2, etc.), you will need to install the arm64 version of Java. We recommend using builds from Azul, the links for which can be found below:

- [Java 8](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-8-lts&os=macos&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk#zulu) or versions ≤ 1.16
- [Java 17](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&os=macos&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk#zulu) for versions ≥ 1.17

It is recommended to install both Java 8 and Java 17.
