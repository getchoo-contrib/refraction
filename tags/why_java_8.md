title: Why does Prism Launcher ask me to change Java version?

Minecraft versions before 1.17 required Java 8 and have issues with newer Java, while newer versions require Java 17, so you need to change Java version. Some people think Java 8 is very outdated, however, it's actually an LTS, meaning it's still getting updates.

If one of your mods is weird and requires newer Java, you can bypass this, by going to instance settings-Java and ticking 'Skip java compatibility checks', but be aware of potential issues, such as [random CMEs](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-149777).
