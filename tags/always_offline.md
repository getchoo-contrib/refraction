If you recently updated Prism Launcher on Windows and you are now unable to do anything in Prism Launcher that would require an internet connection (i.e. logging in, downloading mods/modpacks and more), try uninstalling the launcher and then reinstalling it again.

If you are using a portable installation, it should be sufficient to delete the `tls` folder and then extract the zip again.

See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/issues/660) for more information.
