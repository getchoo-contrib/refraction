title: Binary Search - A method of finding problems with mods
color: blue
---

The binary search is a way of finding a faulty thing amongst a lot of other things, without having to remove the things one-by-one. This is useful for finding a broken mod among hundreds of mods, without having to spend time testing the mods one-by-one.

The procedure is simple:

1. Remove half of the existing things, and put them aside.
2. Run the program / game.
3. Does the issue still exist?
   If YES: Repeat from step 1 with the current things.
   IF NO: Swap out the current things with the ones set aside, and repeat from step 1.
4. Repeat this process until the problematic thing/s have been found.
